pstatsviewer
=============

A Graphical, Interactive PStats viewer/diff tool for IPython Notebook.

To see what the output of this project looks like statically, you can look at

(note that the interactive widget will not display on nbviewer).

To run the Example Notebook locally:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `ipython notebook examples/ExampleView.ipynb`.
